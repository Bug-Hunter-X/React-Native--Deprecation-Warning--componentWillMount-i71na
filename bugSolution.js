The `useEffect` hook provides a modern solution for handling side effects that were previously managed with `componentWillMount`.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setData([]);
  }, []);

  return (
    // ... your component JSX
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This version uses the empty array `[]` as the second argument to `useEffect`, ensuring that the effect runs only once after the initial render, akin to `componentWillMount`'s behavior.
